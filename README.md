# fuckart
This little project started as anger ventilation and turned into full time procrastination. Basically the idea behind it was to write FUCK! sign with words FUCK!, which wasnt that hard and my roommate suggested it should output gradually. And then i added some stuff that solves terminal size problems and user interaction and there is this non-perfect script we have now.
